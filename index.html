                  <p>&mdash; People call me «one of the most discussed and global issue of our time».
                    It’s easy to get me and it's difficult to diagnose it.
                    My hobby is walking in crowded and cool places in my spare time.
                    I really love to be in people, but, unfortunately, they are afraid of me.</p>
